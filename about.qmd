Hi! I am Mavis, a Y3 NUS student, currently doing a double major in CNM and Business. I love tracking financial data, which is why I have wanted to visualise the US inflation data as my project.

I am a budding business news reporter, and during my internship at CNBC, I was acquainted with the workings of financial markets and central banks. It was then and there that I decided I had the ambition to become a television journalist, to report breaking news about the markets for viewers.
