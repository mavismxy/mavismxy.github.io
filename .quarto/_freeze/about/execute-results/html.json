I love tracking financial data, which is why I have wanted to visualise the US inflation data as my project.\n\nI am a budding business news reporter, and during my internship at CNBC, I was acquainted with the workings of financial markets and central banks. It was then and there that I decided I had the ambition to become a television journalist, to report breaking news about the markets for viewers.\n\nYou can visit my portfolio here for more details <https://mavisreporting.wordpress.com/>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IMG_3475.JPG)\n:::\n:::\n",
